    "In this project, you will build an Agentic system that automatically responds to incidents in your AWS accounts using a multi-agent workflow. This system is designed to handle monitoring, analysis, and resolution with minimal manual intervention, helping you manage security and operational issues efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is composed of four main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1️⃣ Monitoring Agent\n",
    "This part uses an automated tool to fetch CloudWatch logs from your AWS account for the services you care about, such as IAM, S3, EC2 etc. It helps collect real-time data on activities and potential issues within your environment, which is essential for identifying anomalies or failures quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ Diagnosis Agent\n",
    "Once the logs are collected, the Diagnosis Agent analyzes the information provided by the Monitoring Agent to identify potential security risks, misconfigurations, or compliance issues. It then uses a web search tool to find remediation steps and best practices, creates a detailed diagnostic report, and prepares it for the resolution phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣ Resolution Agent\n",
    "Triggered after the diagnosis phase, the Resolution Agent takes the diagnostic report and uses it to create a Jira ticket. This ticket will include a clear description of the identified issue along with recommended remediation steps, ensuring that your team or stakeholders can take action promptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4️⃣ Observability and Tracing\n",
    "Throughout the entire workflow, the system uses tracing and observability tools like LangSmith to track what each agent is doing. This makes it easier to debug, monitor progress, and ensure transparency in the automated incident response process.\n"

      "In the last 5 days of IAM logs, several critical events were identified that could indicate potential security issues or compliance violations in your AWS account. These logs include authorization failures, access denials, and internal service errors. Here are the key findings:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Authorization Failures and Access Denials:**\n",
      "   - Multiple access denied errors were found for user `trail123` when attempting to perform various IAM actions such as `ListAWSServiceAccessForOrganization`, `DescribeOrganization`, `ListMFADevices`, `ListUserTags`, `ListAccessKeys`, `ListSSHPublicKeys`, `GetLoginProfile`, `GetAccountSummary`, and `ListServiceSpecificCredentials`.\n",
