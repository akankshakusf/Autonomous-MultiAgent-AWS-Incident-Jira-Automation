    "# Autonomous Incident Response System for AWS\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will build an Agentic system to respond to incidents in your AWS accounts. This is a multi-agent system that composes 4 main components: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Monitoring**: This composes of a tool that enables the agent to get CloudWatch logs from a user account based on their service of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Diagnosis**: This includes diagnosis events that are seen through the monitoring agent. The diagnosis agent will fetch the information from the monitoring agent, use a web search tool to look for remediations, create a report and then use that report in the next resolution agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resolution**: This portion of the solution will be triggered by a diagnosis done from the step before. Once the diagnoses is done with the clear report, then the content of the report is used in the description of the JIRA ticket that the agent creates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution will also contain aspects for observability and tracing but without further ado, let's get right into it."

      "### High-Level Summary\n",
      "The logs indicate several critical events, including internal service errors, throttling exceptions, and potential security incidents. Here are the key findings:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Internal Service Errors**:\n",
      "   - There are multiple instances of internal service errors, such as `InternalFailure` from CloudWatch and an error from the Cost and Usage service.\n",
      "   - Example:\n",
      "     ```json\n",
      "     {\n",
      "       \"eventTime\": \"2025-06-18T15:05:37Z\",\n",
      "       \"eventSource\": \"ce.amazonaws.com\",\n",
      "       \"eventName\": \"GetCostAndUsage\",\n",
      "       \"errorCode\": \"InternalFailure\",\n",
      "       \"errorMessage\": \"We messed up somewhere, sorry. There was an internal error with the service.\"\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Throttling Exceptions**:\n",
      "   - Several throttling exceptions were encountered, indicating that the rate of API requests may be exceeding the allowed limit.\n",
      "   - Example:\n",
      "     ```json\n",
      "     {\n",
      "       \"eventTime\": \"2025-06-18T10:50:47.273000\",\n",
      "       \"eventSource\": \"bedrock.amazonaws.com\",\n",
      "       \"eventName\": \"Converse\",\n",
      "       \"errorCode\": \"ThrottlingException\",\n",
      "       \"errorMessage\": \"Too many tokens, please wait before trying again.\"\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Security Incidents**:\n",
      "   - No explicit security incidents like unauthorized access or policy violations were found in the logs. However, monitoring for such patterns is recommended.\n",
      "   - Example:\n",
      "     ```json\n",
      "     {\n",
      "       \"eventTime\": \"2025-06-18T14:48:42Z\",\n",
      "       \"eventSource\": \"sts.amazonaws.com\",\n",

      "         \"roleArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::946538336216:role/service-role/CloudTrail_CloudWatchLogs_Role\",\n",
      "         \"roleSessionName\": \"CLOUDWATCH_LOGS_DELIVERY_SESSION\"\n",
      "       }\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Management Events**:\n",
      "   - Various management events related to IAM, CloudTrail, and other AWS services were logged, indicating routine administrative activities.\n",
      "   - Example:\n",
      "     ```json\n",
      "     {\n",
      "       \"eventTime\": \"2025-06-18T11:08:41.189000\",\n",
      "       \"eventSource\": \"iam.amazonaws.com\",\n",
      "       \"eventName\": \"ListPolicies\",\n",
      "       \"requestParameters\": {\n",
      "         \"scope\": \"AWS\",\n",
      "         \"onlyAttached\": false,\n",
      "         \"pathPrefix\": \"/\"\n",
      "       }\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Detailed Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Critical Errors**:\n",
      "  - The internal service errors need immediate attention to ensure the reliability of the services.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Security Concerns**:\n",
      "  - No explicit security breaches were detected, but it's crucial to continuously monitor for suspicious activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Performance Bottlenecks**:\n",
      "  - Throttling exceptions suggest that the API request rate might need to be adjusted to avoid service disruptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Unusual Patterns**:\n",
      "  - Routine management events are normal, but any deviations from the usual patterns should be investigated.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "While the logs indicate some internal service errors and throttling issues, no explicit security incidents were found. It is recommended to investigate the internal service errors and consider adjusting the API request rate to prevent throttling.\n",

logs for the last 2 days. The logs are extensive, but I will focus on identifying security issues using the default filter patterns. Here is a high-level summary of the key findings:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Security Concerns or Suspicious Activities:**\\\\n   - Several instances of \"InternalFailure\" with service calls indicate potential issues within the service that could be related to security.\\\\n   - An error with the event name \"GetCostAndUsage\" on 2025-06-18T15:03:59Z shows an internal error which might need further investigation.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Specific Log Examples:**\\\\n   - On 2025-06-18T15:03:59Z, an \"InternalFailure\" error occurred during a \"GetCostAndUsage\" call by the root user:\\\\n     ```\\\\n     {\\\\n       \"eventTime\": \"2025-06-18T15:03:59Z\",\\\\n       \"eventSource\": \"ce.amazonaws.com\",\\\\n       \"eventName\": \"GetCostAndUsage\",\\\\n       \"errorMessage\": \"We messed up somewhere, sorry. There was an internal error with the service.\"\\\\n     }\\\\n     ```\\\\n   - Another error on 2025-06-18T15:05:37Z during a \"DescribeAlarms\" call by the root user:\\\\n     ```\\\\n     {\\\\n       \"eventTime\": \"2025-06-18T15:05:37Z\",\\\\n       \"eventSource\": \"monitoring.amazonaws.com\",\\\\n       \"eventName\": \"DescribeAlarms\",\\\\n       \"errorCode\": \"InternalFailure\",\\\\n       \"errorMessage\": \"We messed up somewhere, sorry. There was an internal error with the service.\"\\\\n     }\\\\n     ```\\\\n\\\\n3. **Organizational and Management Events:**\\\\n   - The logs show regular management events such as \"DescribeAccountPolicies\", \"DescribeLogGroups\", and \"DescribeLogStreams\" with no apparent security breaches.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Performance Bottlenecks:**\\\\n   - No explicit performance issues or slowdowns were identified in the logs.\\\\n\\\\n5. **Unusual Patterns that Might Indicate Problems:**\\\\n   - The repeated occurrence of \"InternalFailure\" errors could indicate underlying issues that need to be addressed.\\\\n\\\\nThe logs are organized by the log group \"/aws/cloudtrail/iam-events\" and timestamped chronologically. Recent and critical events are prioritized.</thinking>\\\\n\\\\nHere is the detailed report:\\\\n\\\\n**High-Level Summary:**\\\\nIn the last 2 days of IAM logs, the primary focus was on identifying security issues.

      "Unfortunately, the tool did not find any specific remediation strategies for the identified issues. However, here are some general best practices that can help address these issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Authorization Failure:**\n",
      "   - Review and update IAM policies to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.\n",
      "   - Implement fine-grained access controls to restrict actions like `DeleteUser` to only those users who require it.\n",
      "   - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Access Analyzer to identify and remediate overly permissive policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Internal Service Error:**\n",
      "   - Contact AWS Support to report the internal service error and seek assistance in resolving the issue.\n",
      "   - Monitor AWS Service Health Dashboard for any ongoing service issues or outages.\n",
      "   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff in your applications to handle transient errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Throttling Issues:**\n",
      "   - Review your API request patterns and optimize them to stay within service limits.\n",
      "   - Implement throttling controls in your applications to manage the rate of API requests.\n",
      "   - Consider requesting a limit increase from AWS if your legitimate usage requires higher API request rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Note:** For more specific remediation steps, it is recommended to consult AWS documentation or contact AWS Support directly.\n",
