    "# Autonomous Incident Response System for AWS\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will build an Agentic system to respond to incidents in your AWS accounts. This is a multi-agent system that composes 4 main components: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Monitoring**: This composes of a tool that enables the agent to get CloudWatch logs from a user account based on their service of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Diagnosis**: This includes diagnosis events that are seen through the monitoring agent. The diagnosis agent will fetch the information from the monitoring agent, use a web search tool to look for remediations, create a report and then use that report in the next resolution agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resolution**: This portion of the solution will be triggered by a diagnosis done from the step before. Once the diagnoses is done with the clear report, then the content of the report is used in the description of the JIRA ticket that the agent creates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution will also contain aspects for observability and tracing but without further ado, let's get right into it."

      "2. **Performance Issues:**\n",
      "   - No performance issues or slowdowns were identified in the logs.\n",

      "   - **IAM User Activity:**\n",
      "     - The IAM user `aktest1` performed several API calls, including `CreateUser`, `AssumeRole`, and `Converse`. These activities are typical but frequent monitoring is advised to catch any anomalies.\n",
      "   - **Root User Activity:**\n",
      "     - The root user performed various API calls such as `ListPolicies`, `ListGroups`, and `GetAccountSummary`. All actions were successful, but it is unusual to see root user activity and should be reviewed.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Error Patterns:**\n",
      "   - No critical errors were found in the logs.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Service Outages:**\n",
      "   - No service outages or degradations were detected.\n",

      "Unfortunately, the tool did not find any specific remediation strategies for the identified issues. However, here are some general best practices that can help address these issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Authorization Failure:**\n",
      "   - Review and update IAM policies to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.\n",
      "   - Implement fine-grained access controls to restrict actions like `DeleteUser` to only those users who require it.\n",
      "   - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Access Analyzer to identify and remediate overly permissive policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Internal Service Error:**\n",
      "   - Contact AWS Support to report the internal service error and seek assistance in resolving the issue.\n",
      "   - Monitor AWS Service Health Dashboard for any ongoing service issues or outages.\n",
      "   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff in your applications to handle transient errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Throttling Issues:**\n",
      "   - Review your API request patterns and optimize them to stay within service limits.\n",
      "   - Implement throttling controls in your applications to manage the rate of API requests.\n",
      "   - Consider requesting a limit increase from AWS if your legitimate usage requires higher API request rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Note:** For more specific remediation steps, it is recommended to consult AWS documentation or contact AWS Support directly.\n",
