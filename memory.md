### Security & Compliance Diagnostic Report 1

**Key Findings**

1. **Unauthorized DeleteUser Attempt**

- **Severity**: High
- **Potential Risk**: Compromise of administrative privileges and potential deletion of critical IAM users.
- **Affected Area**: IAM service

2. **Multiple Access Denied Errors**

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Potential Risk**: Misconfigurations or unauthorized access attempts that could lead to security breaches.
- **Affected Area**: IAM service

**Remediation Guidance**

1. **Unauthorized DeleteUser Attempt**

- **Action**: Investigate the user `malicious.actor` for any suspicious activity.
- **Steps**:
    1. Review the permissions and policies associated with the user `malicious.actor`.
    2. Ensure that the user does not have unnecessary administrative privileges.
    3. Consider disabling the user if it is identified as a security threat.
    4. Implement additional monitoring and alerting for any future unauthorized attempts to delete IAM users.

2. **Multiple Access Denied Errors**

- **Action**: Review and update IAM policies to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.
- **Steps**:
    1. Identify the specific IAM actions that were denied.
    2. Check the current IAM policies for the user `malicious.actor`.
    3. Update the policies to restrict access to only necessary actions.
    4. Implement logging and monitoring to track any future access denied errors and investigate their causes.

1. **Denied Access Events**

- **Severity**: High
- **Potential Risk or Affected Area**: Unauthorized access attempts or misconfigured IAM policies

**Remediation Guidance**

- **Review IAM Policies**: Ensure that IAM policies are correctly configured and only grant the necessary permissions to users and roles.
- **Enable MFA**: Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users to add an extra layer of security.

### Security & Compliance Diagnostic Report 3

**Key Findings**

1. **Critical Error with Bedrock Service**

- **Severity**: High
- **Potential Risk**: Operational disruption due to invalid model sequence.

2. **Monitoring Alarms in ALARM State**

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Potential Risk**: Potential issues with the monitored resources or services.

**General Remediation Guidance**

1. **Critical Error with Bedrock Service**

- **Action**: Review the model configurations and refer to the model tool use troubleshooting guide to resolve the issue.
- **Steps**:
    1. Ensure that the model inputs and outputs are correctly formatted.
    2. Validate the model integration with the service.
    3. Check for configuration mismatches or deployment issues.

2. **Monitoring Alarms in ALARM State**

- **Action**: Investigate the root cause of the alarm state by checking the CloudWatch metrics and logs associated with the alarms.
- **Steps**:
    1. Review the specific metrics that triggered the alarms.
    2. Identify underlying resource or configuration issues.
    3. Take appropriate actions such as scaling resources, fixing misconfigurations, or addressing performance bottlenecks.
    4. Review alarm thresholds to ensure they are set correctly to avoid false positives.
